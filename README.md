The goal of this project is to inteface with most of the basic peripherals available on the ts7250-v2.

Planned implementation steps
[x] reliable mmio access to hardware registers
[x] DIO support - yes just the DIO pins, not the whole evgpio system, however this could happen
[ ] Serial support - from ttyS0, to XUARTS
[ ] CAN
[ ] I2C
[ ] SPI
[ ] RS-485/modbus
